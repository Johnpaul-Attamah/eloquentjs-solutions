## Why Eloquent Javascript?
Eloquent Javascript by **Marijn Haverbeke** is one of the few books you will continue to go back to when getting started with Javascript. The best way to learn code is by coding.

## Problem Solved
This repo provides the solutions to the various exercises from this book. I try to explain all the solutions given, with the code comments. If you are just getting started, I will advise you get the book or other good books out there to get hold of (some not all) basics before moving on.
