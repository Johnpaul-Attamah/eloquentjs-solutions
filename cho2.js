/**
 * Question 2
 * Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
 * with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
 * number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
 * When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz"
 * for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
 * "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
 * 
 * (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out
 * a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your
 * labor market value just went up.)

//you need to use elif statement for this instead of just if to avoid calling each number 3 times
// the remainder operator '%' is used to check factors

/**
 * Question 03
 * Chessboard:
 * Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to
 *  separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a # character.
 *  The characters should form a chessboard. Passing this string to console.log 
 *  should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
* When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and 
* change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height
 */
//solution

 * 1. Looking at the output, you can draw grid lines
 * 2. when both rows and column are in even position or odd position print space
 * 3. when either of above print "#" or vice versa
